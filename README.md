# NeighborhoodMap

# Project Name: Neighborhood Map (Project 5 for Udacity Front Developer Nanodegree)

Functionally, this project is a collection of my favorite Indian Restaurants
 in my neighborbood. Murray Hill, New York is nicknamed "Curry Hill" for its high 
 concerntration of South Asian restaurants. They are ample and excellent. 
 
 This simple app provides a short list of a few of my favorite restaurants. 
 A search feature is provided to find the desired venue. 
 Basic contact information is provided for each restaurant from the Foursquare API.

## Credits
This was by far the most complicated project I have worked on to date. I referenced many sources in effort to complete this project, including: 
* Udacity course materials
* Udacity coaches
* Online resources (including: Google Maps API; Yelp API; Foursquare API; Stack Overflow; http://snipplr.com/; W3Schools; random Google searches, etc)
* Previous student submissions (on github: juliusakula; richgieg; lastres0rt; peterchon; allanbreyes; DawoonC, andela-ftchirou; and others)

## Licenses
I did acquire unique API keys for Google Maps, Foursquare, and Yelp for this project.
